# Multimodal Spatial Availability: A Singly-Constrained Measure of Competitive Accessibility by Multiple Modes

The repository is home to the analysis of multi-modal extension of
spatial availability.

*An increasing number of studies within the domain of transportation
planning are concerned with the inequities in accessibility to
opportunities. A dimension of these inequities arises from differences
in access by mode type (e.g., commuting using a car as opposed to
transit). However, methods implemented in current accessibility
literature are lacking within the context of multimodal analysis. This
paper presents an extension of spatial availability, a
singly-constrained competitive accessibility measure, for the context of
multimodal accessibility analysis. We first illustrate the features of
spatial availability that lend itself to multimodal analysis. We then
demonstrate its use on the case study of Low Emission Zones in Madrid
(Spain) and highlight how this policy intervention changes the
accessibility of populations using different modes. In summary, spatial
availability can be used to create and interpret multimodal policy
intervention scenarios unlike previous methods: this creation and
interpretation can help regions envision a more sustainable and
equitable access-to-opportunity landscape.*
