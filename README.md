Recent research has aimed to address the way opportunities are counted
in accessibility analysis. In conventional accessibility measures,
opportunities are often multiply counted, which leads to values of
accessibility that are difficult to interpret. Constraining the
calculations to match a known quantity ensures that the measurements sum
up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of
opportunities), and so each value can be meaningfully related to this
total. A recent such effort is spatial availability, a
singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper we extend
spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or, more
generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel
behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability
We proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. Next,
we apply it to an empirical example in Madrid. We conclude the paper
with suggestions for future research.
