  abstract = {In rapidly-growing metropolitan regions, it is crucial that transportation-related policies and infrastructure are designed to ensure that everyone can participate equitably in economic, social, and civil opportunities. Ride\- hailing services are touted to improve mobility options, but there is scant research that incorporates this mode within an accessibility framework. This paper employs a generalized cost measure in a multi-modal accessibility framework, namely Access Profile Analysis, to assess the role of ridehailing in providing job access to historically under-resourced parts of Toronto, Canada, referred to by the city as Neighborhood Improvement Areas (NIAs). Ridehailing is analyzed both as a mode of commute and as a feeder to the transit network (a first-mile solution). The results indicate that there are two main determinants of the extent to which ridehailing provides additional accessibility over transit: the transit level of service at the origin zone and the zone's proximity to employment opportunities. The ridehailing mode is shown to increase accessibility especially to closer destinations (jobs), with the highest improvement seen in the city's inner suburbs. On the other hand, integrating ridehailing with public transit does little to improve access to jobs. Compared to the rest of the city, NIAs experience a higher accessibility improvement from ridehailing alone, but not from its integration with transit. Nonetheless, job accessibility remains lower in NIAs than in other areas \textendash{} even after the introduction of ridehailing.},

In order to plan for sustainable transport development, there is a need to develop indicators for assessing and monitoring transport development. In this paper we develop a sustainable transport development indicator by making use of the concepts of accessibility and geographical information systems. A modal accessibility gap index is proposed, which is calculated by finding the difference between the accessibility indices of public and private transport, which are in turn determined by accessibilities to opportunities such as the number of population, jobs, shops, and schools by public and private transport. Considering energy-efficiency, public transport will achieve sustainable transport more than private transport. A higher accessibility gap may mean more sustainable development. In the present study, the accessibility gap of Hong Kong in 1991 is compared with that in 1996 to examine whether transport development has been more sustainable. We also discuss how to use the accessibility gap indicator to test land-use and transport-development policies and scenarios to determine the more sustainable ones.},

This paper investigates the social and geographical disparities in accessibility and time competitiveness of public transport in the Oslo region. Both place-based access to employment opportunities and the working population’s individual-specific commutes are measured. The study combines registry data with detailed accessibility metrics and uses descriptive maps and spatial regression models to study transport poverty. The results show that less affluent neighbourhoods suffer from low accessibility and poor time competitiveness of public transport, which is partly related to the suburbanization of poverty. This suggests that the transition to low emission mobility, with re­ strictions on car use, may be especially burdensome in less affluent neighbourhoods. The findings can help policy makers in securing an equitable transition from car to more sustainable transport modes.},

   abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility},

There is however fairly little knowledge in the potential effects of bicycle-train integration policies. The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of bicycle-train integration policies on train ridership and job accessibility for public transport users.
Methods We extended the Dutch National Transport Model ({NVM}) by implementing a detailed bicycle network linked to the public transport network, access/egress mode combinations and station specific access and egress penalties by mode and station type derived from a stated choice survey. Furthermore, the effects of several bicycletrain integration policy scenarios were examined for a case study for Randstad South, in the Netherlands, comprising a dense train network with 54 train stations.
Conclusions Our analysis shows that improving the quality of bicycle routes and parking can substantially increase train ridership and potential job accessibility for train users. Large and medium stations are more sensitive to improvements in},

	abstract = {This study examines the Modal Access Gap ({MAG}) between transit and automobile to employment, groceries, hospitals, and schools in 15-min, 30-min, 45-min, and 60-min travel-time thresholds in the City of Chicago. We use automobile and transit access data from the Metropolitan Chicago Accessibility Explorer and augment it with data from the American Community Survey and the Smart Location Database. We employ a Spatial Lag Model to explore sociodemographic and built-environment correlates of {MAG} and the bivariate local indicator of spatial association to create cluster maps to offer a way to assess the spatial equity of {MAG} as it relates to carless households. The findings indicate that: (1) regardless of the travel-time threshold, the automobile has an advantage over transit in providing access to opportunities, (2) block groups with low {MAG} are concentrated and clustered in the Central Business District, (3) Millennials and car-free households are more likely to reside in areas with lower accessibility gap to employment, groceries, hospitals, and schools for 30-min and 60-min traveltime thresholds, and (4) areas with high access gap and a high proportion of carless households have a higher percentage of African Americans and low-income households. We recommend using the bivariate spatial auto­ correlation analysis to classify areas according to the gap in accessibility and proportion of households without vehicles. This classification is then used to prioritize different planning actions for high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low combinations of {MAG} and the proportion of carless households. We also show that this spatial identification, at least in the case of Chicago, captures racial and economic differences in the underlying pop­ ulation and can help address inequities in accessibility, particularly in high access gap, high carless areas.},

To address the equity aspect of sustainable development, urban facilities should be not only accessible with transportation modes but also is important to ensure equitable accessibility among population groups. This study is aimed to provide a framework to assess accessibility-based horizontal and vertical equity (regarding income) of public facilities. The GIS-based multimodal potential model is adapted to measure the accessibility of households in each area to the facilities located throughout the city by considering different transportation modes and attractiveness of the destinations. Horizontal and vertical equity is assessed using the Gini coefficient and statistical indices. In order to illustrate the applicability of the procedure, the equity of the accessibility to the Kowsar retail chain stores (aimed to support mainly economically vulnerable people) in Isfahan, Iran is evaluated. Results indicate that under the current conditions, low-income population and pedestrians are less advantaged compared to other groups, and the future development plan will exacerbate this concern. This study would assist policy-makers in evaluating the location of urban facilities in terms of spatial equity and give insights into how much the target groups will be affected by future developments.},

  abstract = {In Europe, the share of people aged 65 years and above is expected to increase exponentially, and in 2050, for the first time in human history, the number of older people will be larger than the number of children under the age of 15. Aging is associated with increased vulnerability and dependence on medical care services. For these reasons, providing access to health services to people aged 65 years and over is crucial. From the perspective of social equity, everyone should have the opportunity to access healthcare services equally, but due to economic and geographical issues, achieving this level of equity is challenging. The aim of this study was to fill the gap between scientific and actual practices using an accessibility measure to evaluate urban accessibility to primary healthcare services and to support decision-makers to better allocate resources in local restructuring of welfare policies. The accessibility measure was designed considering both the land use and the transportation components, the local healthcare supply system, and a multimodal transportation network. The methodology was applied to the city of Naples considering Local Health Agency (ASL) healthcare services to the elderly. The ASL is the largest health agency in Europe, consisting of 17 buildings serving nearly 200,000 elderly. The results show that the entire elderly neighborhood population suffers from poor accessibility to primary health services, especially in the city suburbs, and that the methodology could be effectively applied to urban planning strategies to achieve a high quality of life for elderly people. Due to poor dialogue between the authorities, this could help to improve the decision-making process through the lens of social equity.},

  abstract = {Job accessibility depends on the relationship between transport system and land uses. It involves competition for the same set of opportunities among users of various transport modes. This study introduces a multi-modal approach to investigate the impacts of public transport on job accessibility. It adapts the multi-modal two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to measure job accessibility. It collects empirical data to operationalize the method in the context of Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen is chosen because of public transport accounts for a significant share of the city’s commuting trips and the city is a pilot city for China’s Transit Metropolis Strategy. Results show that job accessibility by public transport is much poorer and more unevenly distributed than that by driving car. The former reaches its minimum in the peripheral whereas the latter is relatively high in most areas. Results reveal significant disadvantages in accessing job opportunities for low-income or migrant workers who are dependent on public transport. The consideration of inter-modal competition would further strengthen such disadvantages. Considering that there is often correlation between job accessibility by public transport and social equity, this study illustrates transferable procedures and methods to quantify and visualize such accessibility and to identify spots where there is deficiency in the supply of such accessibility. It demonstrates the importance of incorporating the inter-modal competition into the evaluation of job accessibility in multi-modal contexts. It highlights land use and transport policy countermeasures to improve job accessibility by public transport.},

The travel demand information is reflected into the MCA measure by evaluating and clustering PT and Private Vehicle Transportation (PVT) trip diaries. Both vertical and horizontal equities are measured for the network's Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZs). To redress the inequities, a priority list of operational recommendations for each TAZ is identified. The proposed method is tested with the Greater Melbourne area datasets and the TAZs with the highest inequity along with prescribed operational recommendations are identified. In terms of equitable distribution of public transportation service, a major observation from the case study model was that the outer suburban areas located in the eastern side of the the Melbourne metropolitan area are relatively underserved as compared to the inner and western suburbs.}

The myriad of distinct but familially related access measures created many more options to measure places, but has sown needless confusion. This paper systematically reviews measures of access across disciplines. We categorize measures of access, covering both mainstream and innovative but less widely-used techniques; each access measure (topological, contiguous, cumulative opportunities, utility, flow-based measures) is separated into Primal and Dual measure, based on whether accessibility is represented by the level of reachable opportunities or by the travel impedance. We show access measures are unified by the same intrinsic structure consisting of travel impedance and the opportunities reachable, and that access measured by different methods are equivalent under specific assumptions on travel impedance, and the accounting of relevant opportunities. This paper overviews the use of access measures from the existing literature, and clarifies measures of access, which should help users in the selection and appropriate use of access measures for the relevant context.},

	abstract = {Studies suggest that sprawling and auto-oriented development patterns present more difficulties for people without cars to access economic opportunities. We examine intrametropolitan and intermetropolitan variations in job accessibility by commuting mode as an indicator of auto-oriented urban structure, selecting Boston, Los Angeles, and Tokyo as study areas. Although in both {US} and Japanese metropolitan areas, job accessibility is significantly lower for public transit users than for auto users, job accessibility for public transit users in the {US} cases is strikingly lower than in Tokyo. The international comparison provides a clear picture of the significant disadvantage in accessing job opportunities encountered by {US} workers who are unable to use private vehicles. The empirical results uncover an important dimension of urban structure that deserves much attention from planners and policymakers.},

This case study of the Detroit metropolitan region uses 2000 census data and a gravity-based model of transportation accessibility to test differences in access to jobs among places and people, and provides support for recent calls for reconceptualizing spatial mismatch. It shows that even though Detroit experiences the greatest distance between African Americans and jobs of any region in the country, most central city neighborhoods offer an advantage in accessibility to jobs compared to most other places in the metropolitan region – as long as a resident has a car. Policies aimed at helping carless people gain access to automobiles may be an effective means of improving the employment outcomes of inner-city residents.},

   abstract = {Rapid demographic aging in countries around the world has prompted an interest in understanding the mobility patterns of seniors. While much research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding trip length. A joint discrete–continuous modeling framework allows us to examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn from Montreal’s Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal. In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing the mobility of seniors.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

   abstract = {Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.},

   journal = {International Journal of Health Geographics},
   volume = {9},
   number = {52},
   pages = {1-9},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND:Geographical access to health care facilities is known to influence health services usage. As societies age, accessibility to health care becomes an increasingly acute public health concern. It is known that seniors tend to have lower mobility levels, and it is possible that this may negatively affect their ability to reach facilities and services. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the mobility situation of seniors vis-a-vis the spatial distribution of health care facilities, to identify areas where accessibility is low and interventions may be required.METHODS:Accessibility is implemented using a cumulative opportunities measure. Instead of assuming a fixed bandwidth (i.e. a distance threshold) for measuring accessibility, in this paper the bandwidth is defined using model-based estimates of average trip length. Average trip length is an all-purpose indicator of individual mobility and geographical reach. Adoption of a spatial modelling approach allows us to tailor these estimates of travel behaviour to specific locations and person profiles. Replacing a fixed bandwidth with these estimates permits us to calculate customized location- and person-based accessibility measures that allow inter-personal as well as geographical comparisons. Data The case study is Montreal Island. Geo-coded travel behaviour data, specifically average trip length, and relevant traveller's attributes are obtained from the Montreal Household Travel Survey. These data are complemented with information from the Census. Health care facilities, also geo-coded, are extracted from a comprehensive business point database. Health care facilities are selected based on Standard Industrial Classification codes 8011-21 (Medical Doctors and Dentists).RESULTS:Model-based estimates of average trip length show that travel behaviour varies widely across space. With the exception of seniors in the downtown area, older residents of Montreal Island tend to be significantly less mobile than people of other age cohorts. The combination of average trip length estimates with the spatial distribution of health care facilities indicates that despite being more mobile, suburban residents tend to have lower levels of accessibility compared to central city residents. The effect is more marked for seniors. Furthermore, the results indicate that accessibility calculated using a fixed bandwidth would produce patterns of exposure to health care facilities that would be difficult to achieve for suburban seniors given actual mobility patterns.CONCLUSIONS:The analysis shows large disparities in accessibility between seniors and non-seniors, between urban and suburban seniors, and between vehicle owning and non-owning seniors. This research was concerned with potential accessibility levels. Follow up research could consider the results reported here to select case studies of actual access and usage of health care facilities, and related health outcomes},

   abstract = {Parks are elemental components of urban landscapes that provide environmental and social function value. In particular, urban parks provide spaces for open-air physical activity. In order to enjoy the opportunities for activities in parks, users must have reasonable access to these resources. A starting point for inquiries about utilization and potential benefits of urban green spaces is an assessment of their geographical accessibility. Of particular interest, in terms of potential users of parks, are children, whose geographical range is limited by their ability to traverse space using nonmotorized modes of transportation, or by their dependence on adults for common forms of motorized mobility. The objective of this paper is to measure accessibility to urban parks from the perspective of children traveling by walking in Montreal, Canada. Implementation of accessibility measures is supported by statistical analysis of trip length using Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys database. Estimates of trip length based on attributes such as age, gender, income class, family structure, as well as geographical location are used to calculate accessibility to urban parks. We evaluate the relationship between the distribution of children population and conditions of accessibility to urban parks to understand the potential for use and possible spatial disparities in the distribution of urban parks. This research contributes to the assessment of the distribution of access to urban parks by children, and can assist planners and policy makers to improve the supply of parks, while accounting for the mobility patterns of children.

The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the {FCA} method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model.

In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the general practitioner within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in rural areas has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many rural areas. Although ‘accessibility’ is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed settlement characteristic of most rural areas elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results Suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between rural areas near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations of most rural general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians.},

It points to general regularities in various systems of mass transit that lead to the similarity in {TLD}.

These studies have employed different indicators useful to assess a sector's degree of geographic clustering, or to characterize the nature of the scale on which localization occurs. However, less work has been conducted to identify significant clustering of industrial activity at the sub-regional level. The objective of this study is to investigate the spatial clustering of high-tech and knowledge-intensive firms in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. We do this by means of the use of a spatial scan statistic. Application of this statistic leads us to conjecture that accessibility to transportation infrastructure and skilled labour contribute to the formation of industrial clusters in these sectors. Our conjecture is borne by a set of logit models that identify these two factors as significantly contributing to cluster membership.},

In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.},

Accessibility is a compelling concept that has proven more difficult to operationalize than mobility, which helps to explain why so many accessibility metrics have been developed for urban research and planning practice. To assess the state of these metrics, we reviewed 54 of them in light of their theoretical basis, data requirements, units of analysis, travel modes and trip purposes accounted for, and potential applications to planning practice. We also reviewed the substantial literature on accessibility measurement and interviewed planning practitioners who are applying accessibility metrics in practice. We find that accessibility theory and measurement has advanced more rapidly than applications in practice. However, a new generation of tools is emerging that may accelerate the move to accessibility planning. Although many of the measures focus on a single travel mode, the number of multimodal metrics is growing. Most of the measures are designed for regional-scale planning and scenario evaluation; only a few to date are intended for project evaluation. Takeaway for practice: The 54 accessibility metrics and tools we reviewed vary widely and none stands out as obviously superior for planning practice. Although most calculate the accessibility of places, and many do so reasonably well, we see the most promise in measures of the accessibility of travelers, which can then be aggregated for place-based analyses while still shedding light on how access can vary substantially across different types of travelers. The principal challenge to broadly deploying accessibility analyses in practice in the years ahead is in developing measures that meaningfully measure the many salient dimensions of access, have manageable data requirements, and are understandable to planners, public officials, and community members.},

	doi = {10.1080/01944363.2020.1850321},
	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings
A growing consensus has formed among planners, especially planning scholars, that promoting accessibility is a major policy goal. However, efforts to promote accessibility-based planning face a conceptual impediment: a common assumption that equates the benefits of accessibility to travel cost savings ({TCS}). Starting from this assumption, many researchers have interpreted the absence of {TCS} (e.g., savings in commuting costs and reductions in vehicle miles traveled [{VMT}]) as evidence undermining the rationale for accessibility-promoting strategies such as jobs-housing balance and transit-oriented development ({TOD}). In this study I challenge these interpretations by suggesting that accessibility improvements can result in not only {TCS} but also destination utility gains, which means the individual satisfaction from interacting with or choosing desirable destinations. The absence of {TCS} from accessibility-promoting policies can be explained by accessibility gains manifesting as destination utility gains. To analyze the importance of destination utility gains, I engage with literatures in economic geography and travel behavior and examine some recent urban trends (e.g., the rise of city-to-suburb commuting). I further estimate residential location choice models to test whether households value accessibility beyond the benefit of {TCS}. Results from the Puget Sound ({WA}) and Southeast Michigan regions support the hypothesis, demonstrating that destination utility gains shape residential location decisions.
Takeaway for practice
Planners should not automatically interpret the absence of {TCS} as evidence that accessibility-promoting strategies are not working. To advance accessibility-based planning, planners should start to explore and measure the various forms of destination utility gains. The evaluation framework for land use and transportation policies should shift from being centered on {TCS} alone to being accessibility based.},

However, assessing the broad impacts of policy and technology choices is a formidable challenge, as exemplified in life-cycle analysis of the implications of alternative energy and mobility technologies. A number of research groups are using dynamic modeling techniques, including biocomplexity, system dynamics, and thermodynamic analysis, to investigate the impacts on ecological and human systems of major shifts such as climate change and the associated policy and technology responses. These techniques can yield at least a partial understanding of dynamic system behavior, enabling a more integrated approach to systems analysis, beneficial intervention, and improvement of resilience. Recommendations are provided for continued research to achieve progress in the dynamic modeling and sustainable management of complex systems.},

The city of Columbus, Ohio, {USA} is attempting to enhance residents' accessibility by providing new public transit services. These new services include a major Transit System Redesign ({TSR}) of the conventional bus network and the introduction of a new bus rapid transit, named {CMAX}. Using a high-resolution space-time accessibility measure, we analyze whether these new public transit services will change residents' accessibility to job and healthcare in an underserved neighborhood of Columbus. Also, we assess whether enhancing the {CMAX} service to reduce delays (e.g., reserved lane, oﬀ-board payment system) will improve accessibility. The high-resolution space-time accessibility measure in this study uses published public transit schedules via the General Transit Feed Speciﬁcation ({GTFS}). We use multiple departure times during a day to account for the temporal ﬂuctuations of accessibility based on the transit schedule changes. We also consider the operating hours of job opportunities and healthcare services. Results suggest that the {TSR} yields ambiguous beneﬁts for accessibility to jobs and healthcare. However, the new {CMAX} service and its potential upgrades lead to a substantial increase in both job and healthcare accessibility. The results can be used for city oﬃcials and urban planners to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of public transit innovations in improving accessibility.},

It is a contested instrument, with supporters who think it is a fair “polluter pays” instrument that especially benefits more deprived communities, while opponents fear an unequal social impact on people’s accessibility and finances. This study wants to add a data-driven perspective to the discussion by simultaneously analysing the unequal exposure to air pollution and the unequal accessibility impact, in a comparative study of the {LEZs} in London and Brussels. The analysis combines a conventional multivariate regression analysis with a geographically weighted regression ({GWR}) modelling to define the local spatial variation in the relationships, which is of particular concern when considering an explicitly spatial problem and solution. The study shows that {GWR} is a promising method in distributional environmental justice research through identifying parts of the city where effects are more unequal, as such facilitating customized policy in­ struments and targeted support.},

This paper conducts a modelling approach exploring the impact of four groups of variables on the public acceptability of {LEZs}: (i) socio-economic and demographic characteristics; (ii) personal attitudes; (iii) travel-related variables; and (iv) perceptions and mobility habits linked to {LEZs}. The city of Madrid, Spain, is a case study of great interest because a {LEZ} called “Madrid Central” has been recently implemented. A total of 799 individual questionnaires were used to calibrate an ordered logit model. Results indicate that socio-economic and demographic variables are weakly related to the level of public acceptability towards the {LEZ}. On the contrary, the political ideology of individuals, their environmental awareness, their primary transport mode, the use of shared mobility systems, and the frequency of access to “Madrid Central” have a higher explanatory power. The results may be useful for policy-makers to understand the factors that increase the public acceptability of {LEZs}.},

These restrict the entry of vehicles based on the emission standard the vehicles were originally constructed to meet, but the restrictions vary considerably. This paper reviews the evidence on the efﬁcacy of {LEZs} to improve urban air quality in ﬁve {EU} countries (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and {UK}), and concludes that there have been mixed results. There is some evidence from ambient measurements that {LEZs} in Germany, which restrict passenger cars as well as heavy duty vehicles ({HDVs}), have reduced long term average {PM}10 and {NO}2 concentrations by a few percent. Elsewhere, where restrictions are limited to {HDVs}, the picture is much less clear. This may be due to the large number of confounding factors. On the other hand there is some, albeit limited, evidence that {LEZs} may result in larger reductions in concentrations of carbonaceous particles, due to trafﬁc making a larger contribution to ambient concentrations of these particles than to {PM}10 and {PM}2.5. The effects of day to day variations in meteorology on concentrations often mask more subtle effects of a {LEZ}. In addition, separating the direct effects of a {LEZ} from the effects of other policy measures, the economy and the normal renewal of the vehicle ﬂeet is not easy, and may give rise to false results.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the factors driving inequalities in theimpacts of low-emissions zones ({LEZs}) on job accessibility across differentoccupational categories in 8 French cities. It analyzes six key drivers thatmay explain disparities in {LEZ} impacts: ownership of polluting vehicles,presence of workers’ residences and workplaces within the {LEZ}, accessi-bility of workers’ homes and workplaces via public transportation, andfeasibility of active transportation modes for commuting between homesand workplaces. The findings reveal that the implementation of {LEZs} haspredominantly regressive effects in 6 out of the 8 cities examined. Despitea higher concentration of skilled workers and jobs within the {LEZ}, result-ing in significant accessibility losses for this group, low-skilled workersbear a greater burden due to the limited availability of public transporta-tion near their residences and workplaces, longer distances between theirhomes and jobs, and a higher proportion of polluting vehicles. These re-sults provide insights into the potential for implementing complementarypolicies to address the anti-redistributive impacts of {LEZs}.},

This paper presents insights into how {LEZs} impact retail activity, innovatively including perspectives from both residents and retailers. A two-pronged research approach was implemented in Madrid, with two survey campaigns that analysed key drivers impacting residents’ shopping activity and retailer sales levels within {LEZs}. The research design was based on discrete choice analyses. The main results indicate that private vehicle users with limited access to {LEZ} are expected to decrease their shopping activity within the {LEZ}. At the same time, inequalities in performance emerge between different types of stores, according to turnover and time at the location. The results provide policymakers with insights into more inclusive design and implementation of {LEZ}.},

	abstract = {Although Low Emission Zones ({LEZs}) have been adopted to address the environmental challenge of improving air quality in urban contexts worldwide, limited attention has been paid to studying their effects on promoting a shift to greener modes. This paper aims to gain insight into that issue by studying the case of “Madrid Central”, a {LEZ} recently implemented in Spain. A survey campaign was conducted to explore changes in modal shift declared by respondents due to the {LEZ} implementation. Based on that, a discrete choice analysis was conducted to identify key factors determining changes in the modal share after implementing the {LEZ}. The results show the high impact of the {LEZ} on decreasing car use and promoting cleaner modes thereby contributing to reduce air pollution. The paper concludes that modal shift is mainly associated with socio-demographic variables, individual perceptions towards {LEZs} and mobility habits. By contrast, attitudinal variables were not found relevant for explaining modal shift. The effectiveness of “Madrid Central” in reducing car use provides policy-makers with lessons and a guidelines for implementing {LEZs}. Given the scarcity of research about that specific topic, the results are scalable to other experiences in the international context.},

	abstract = {Accessibility plays a fundamental role in the transport network. In fact, accessibility may be used for investigating the (un)even distribution of economic activities, or the (dis)equilibrium in the development of different regional performances. In particular, accessibility analysis can be considered as a first exploratory step in the understanding of people's needs and behaviour, especially in the framework of transport network structures. From the methodological viewpoint, accessibility has a long tradition, starting in the 1950's with the pioneering work by Hansen, who defined accessibility as the potential of opportunity for interaction. Such a definition can also be considered as an integrated framework of all subsequent definitions. The aim of this paper is to explore accessibility in the German commuting network, by focusing attention on the relevance of the impedance form associated with it. The conventional (potential) accessibility function - in the light of the related economic activities - is used as a suitable instrument to identify the major German hub/attraction nodes. In this formulation, different types of decay functions are used as impedance forms. In our applications we consider home-to-work commuters travelling between 439 German districts, for both 2003 and 2007. We carry out a comparative analysis of the accessibility values in these years, by outlining the different emerging hierarchies, resulting from the use of different impedance forms. In addition, we explore which type of accessibility indicator best matches the connectivity network. The final aim is to identify - by means of different accessibility functions - homogeneous vs. heterogeneous characteristics of the German commuting network.},
